# The Problem
As an administrator, you have a crucial goal of improving the SEO rankings of your website. One essential aspect of optimizing your website's search engine visibility is analyzing the internal linking structure. By understanding how your web pages are linked to the home page, you can identify areas for improvement and implement strategies to enhance your SEO performance.

This tool will provide you with insights into the internal linking structure, helping you understand the hierarchy and flow of link juice throughout your site. By manually searching for ways to optimize these internal links, you can improve the overall navigation and user experience while boosting your SEO rankings.



# Technical Specifications
To solve this problem, I will implement a web crawling mechanism that will traverse the website's pages starting from the home page and follow the links to other pages. The crawler will collect information about the links between pages and present it to the administrator in a meaningful way.

# Technical decisions and reasoning:
Web crawling: I chose to implement a web crawler because it allows us to programmatically navigate through the website and gather information about the pages and their links. This approach provides a comprehensive view of the website's structure.

Starting from the home page: I decided to begin the crawling process from the home page since it serves as the central hub of the website. By following the links from the home page, we can ensure that all connected pages are discovered.

Collecting link information: The crawler will gather data about the links between pages, including the source page and the target page. This information will help the administrator understand the website's interconnectedness and identify potential improvements for SEO.

# Code functionality and rationale:
The code will start by accessing the home page URL provided by the administrator. It will then extract all the links present on the home page and add them to a queue. The crawler will continue until the queue is empty, following the links in a breadth-first manner.

For each visited page, the crawler will collect link information and store it in a data structure, such as a graph or a database. This data structure will maintain the relationship between pages, allowing the administrator to analyze the website's structure later.

To prevent infinite loops or excessive crawling, the crawler will keep track of visited pages and ensure that a page is not revisited. It can also implement certain rules or filters to avoid crawling irrelevant pages or external websites.

# Solution and achieving the desired outcome:
By implementing this web crawling mechanism, the administrator will be able to see a comprehensive view of how the web pages are linked to the home page. This information can be used to manually search for ways to improve SEO rankings.

The crawler will provide the administrator with insights into the website's structure, including the number of pages, the depth of links, and potentially identify issues like broken links or orphaned pages. Armed with this information, the administrator can make informed decisions to optimize the website's SEO and enhance its visibility in search engine rankings.

Overall, this solution allows the administrator to gain visibility into the website's link structure, which serves as a basis for identifying potential SEO improvements. It provides a systematic approach to analyzing the website and enables manual interventions to enhance the website's search engine rankings.
